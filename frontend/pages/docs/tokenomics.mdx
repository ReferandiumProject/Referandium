# Tokenomics

## Overview

Referandium operates on a **pure SOL economy** with a unique **refundable rental model** for Gookies. Unlike traditional NFT marketplaces or prediction markets, our system prioritizes **capital efficiency** and **sustainable revenue generation** through platform fees, not ownership sales.

> 💰 **Core Principle**: Users don't buy assets—they rent management rights and get refunded.

> ⚠️ **Development Status**: This tokenomics model describes the target system currently in active development. Smart contracts and commission distribution mechanisms are being built and tested on Solana testnet.

## SOL Flow Architecture

### How SOL Moves Through the System

#### 1. **Prescription Market Signals**
```
User → Signals YES/NO with SOL → Locked in market pool → Released at resolution
```

- Users signal future outcomes by locking SOL in markets
- SOL remains in escrow until market closes
- No platform fee on signaling (currently)
- Pure consensus mechanism

#### 2. **Gookie Rental System**
```
User → Bids SOL in auction → Escrowed in treasury → Market closes → Refund (minus fee)
```

**Example Flow:**
1. User bids **10 SOL** for "Champions League 2026" Gookie
2. SOL transferred to treasury wallet on-chain
3. User manages market, attracts **200 SOL trading volume**
4. Market closes successfully
5. Platform takes **10% rental fee (1 SOL)**
6. User earns **4% volume commission (8 SOL)**
7. User receives: **9 SOL refund + 8 SOL commission = 17 SOL total**
8. **Net profit: 7 SOL (70% ROI!)**

> 🍪 **Gookie Economics**: This is a **rental**, not a sale. Your capital comes back—plus commission earnings!

## Revenue Model

### Platform Fee Structure

Referandium generates revenue through **two revenue streams**: rental fees and platform volume fees.

#### Rental Fees

| Fee Type | Rate | Applies To | When Charged |
|----------|------|------------|--------------|
| **Gookie Rental Fee** | 10% | Auction winners | At market close |
| **Early Exit Penalty** | 25% | Renters who abandon | On early termination |
| **Volume Incentive** | -2% discount | High-volume renters | Per successful close |

#### Market Volume Fee Breakdown

**Every signal (YES/NO vote) in a market generates a small platform fee. This fee is split between the platform and the Gookie renter (market manager).**

| Stakeholder | Commission Rate | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Platform** | 2-3% | Platform operations, development, treasury |
| **Gookie Renter** | 3-5% | Market manager commission (your profit!) |
| **Total Market Fee** | 5-8% | Combined fee on trading volume |

> 💰 **Key Insight**: As a Gookie renter, **you earn 3-5% of ALL trading volume** in your market. The more you promote, the more you earn!

### Fee Breakdown Example

**Scenario: User rents Gookie for 5 SOL**

| Item | Amount (SOL) |
|------|--------------|
| Initial Bid | 5.00 |
| Escrowed | 5.00 |
| Platform Fee (10%) | -0.50 |
| **Refund to User** | **4.50** |
| **Platform Revenue** | **0.50** |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Fees are only charged on **successful market completion**. If the market fails to launch or is canceled by admin, users receive a **100% refund**.

## Gookie Rental Economics

### Why Rentals Work

Traditional NFT auctions suffer from:
- ❌ High capital requirements (permanent purchase)
- ❌ Illiquid secondary markets
- ❌ Zero utility after purchase

Referandium's rental model solves this:
- ✅ **Lower barrier to entry**: Rent for 1 SOL, get 0.9 SOL back
- ✅ **Active utility period**: Manage and promote your market
- ✅ **Predictable costs**: Fixed 10% fee, no surprises
- ✅ **Capital efficiency**: Your SOL isn't permanently locked

### Renter Incentives

**What renters gain:**
- Market management rights for themed questions
- Branding opportunity (e.g., "Powered by @YourTwitter")
- **3-5% commission on all market volume** 💰
- Prestige and leaderboard ranking
- Community engagement and followers

**What renters pay:**
- 10% platform fee on rental amount (refunded if market succeeds)
- Opportunity cost during lock period
- Time investment in market promotion

> 💡 **Strategic Play**: Successful renters often **profit more from volume commission** than the rental fee costs. A market with 500 SOL volume earns you 15-25 SOL in commission alone!

**ROI Examples:**

| Rental Bid | Market Volume | Renter Commission (4%) | Rental Refund | Total Return | Net Profit | ROI |
|------------|---------------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----|
| 5 SOL | 50 SOL | 2 SOL | 4.5 SOL | 6.5 SOL | 1.5 SOL | +30% |
| 10 SOL | 200 SOL | 8 SOL | 9 SOL | 17 SOL | 7 SOL | +70% |
| 20 SOL | 1000 SOL | 40 SOL | 18 SOL | 58 SOL | 38 SOL | +190% |

## Treasury Management

### Treasury Wallet Functions

The treasury wallet (`5vJggeRkrFSZBJw6rZvWNzuRbKTe4g44pQEwaBcyZVBP`) holds:

1. **Escrowed Gookie rental deposits**
2. **Platform fee accumulation**
3. **Market signal pools** (future implementation)

### Treasury Allocation

Platform fees are distributed as follows:

```
Fee Revenue Distribution:
├─ 50% Development & Operations
├─ 25% Community Rewards Pool
├─ 15% Marketing & Growth
└─ 10% Emergency Reserve
```

**Transparency:**
- All treasury transactions are on-chain and auditable
- Monthly reports published to community
- Multi-sig security (planned for Q2 2026)

## Refund Mechanics

### Standard Refund Flow

```
Market Close → Fee Calculation → Automatic Refund → Wallet Credit (< 5 seconds)
```

**Refund Triggers:**
1. Market reaches end date
2. All signals are resolved
3. Admin verifies outcome (if required)
4. Smart contract executes refund

### Refund Scenarios

| Scenario | User Deposit | Fee | Refund | Timeline |
|----------|--------------|-----|--------|----------|
| **Successful Market** | 10 SOL | 10% (1 SOL) | 9 SOL | Instant |
| **Early Exit (by user)** | 10 SOL | 25% (2.5 SOL) | 7.5 SOL | Instant |
| **Admin Cancellation** | 10 SOL | 0% (0 SOL) | 10 SOL | Instant |
| **Market Failure** | 10 SOL | 0% (0 SOL) | 10 SOL | Within 24h |

> 🔒 **Safety Net**: If a market is canceled due to platform error, users receive **110% refund** (10% bonus as apology).

---

## Fee Burning (Future)

### Deflationary Mechanism (Planned for Q3 2026)

Once a governance token is launched:
- 50% of platform fees will be used to **buy back and burn** tokens
- Creates deflationary pressure
- Rewards long-term holders
- Aligns platform growth with token value

**Example:**
```
Monthly Fee Revenue: 100 SOL
→ 50 SOL used to buy governance tokens
→ Tokens burned permanently
→ Supply decreases, value increases
```

## FAQ

### Why 10% fee?

We benchmarked against traditional platforms:
- **Polymarket**: 2% + spread manipulation
- **Kalshi**: 7% + withdrawal fees
- **Traditional casinos**: 5-10% house edge

Our 10% rental fee + commission model is superior because:
- You get 90% back as refund (it's a rental, not a loss)
- You earn 3-5% commission on market volume (profit potential!)
- No hidden fees or spreads
- 100% transparent on-chain (once deployed)

### Can fees change?

Yes, but only through **community governance** (once token launches). Current fee structure is locked for Phase 1.

### What if I lose my private key?

Refunds are sent to the wallet that placed the bid. **Always secure your seed phrase.** We cannot recover lost wallets.
